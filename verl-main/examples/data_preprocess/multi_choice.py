Please play the role of a teacher and categorize the types of grammatical errors in the sentence and answer me only the correct options(A,B,C,D....),separated by ",".
The types of grammatical errors are as follows: 
A."FehlerOrth":"This mainly involves misspelling of words, words incorrectly written separately or together, misspelling of nouns in initial case, and punctuation errors.",
B."FehlerMorph":"It mainly involves errors in word changes, such as errors in changing the form of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and articles; errors in choosing the auxiliary verbs haben, sein, and werden; and errors in comparative and superlative forms.",
C."Wortstellung":"This mainly involves failure to follow the rules of German order for the constituents of a sentence, including improper verb position in main clauses, verb position in subordinate clauses, position of separable prefixes on separable verbs, position of question words and negatives, and position of the minutiae (Modalpartikeln); incorrect ordering of the constituents in the middle field, incorrect word order within noun phrases, and incorrect ordering of the expressions involving names, dates, and places.",
D."Valenz":"It mainly involves grammatical errors in the syntactically required collocation of verbs, nouns, adjectives and prepositions, including incorrect collocation of grams with objects after verbs, habitual collocation of nouns with specific prepositions as a result of using the wrong preposition or collocating with prepositions, improper use of prepositions after adjectives, and incorrect use of the required grams after prepositions.",
E."Supplement":"It mainly involves the incorrect use of temporal and situational descriptors.",
F."Korrelat":"The main problems are related to the incorrect use of guiding words in clauses or infinitive constructions, including: subordinating conjunctions in general clauses (e.g. weil, dass, etc.), the incorrect use of relative pronouns or adverbs in relative clauses (e.g. der, wo, wor√ºber, etc.), and conjunctions in infinitive constructions with zu (e.g. um ...). zu, anstatt ... zu, ohne ... zu, anstatt ... zu, ohne ... zu) in infinitive constructions with zu.",
G."Konnektor":"It mainly involves the improper use of parallel conjunctions.",
H."Kongruenz":"It mainly involves subject-verb agreement or an inconsistency between the pronoun and the antecedent in person, number, or case.",
I."Andere":"It mainly involves the absence or redundancy of sentence components such as subjects, formal subjects, predicates, separable verb prefixes, quantifiers, qualifiers, comparatives, and so on."
